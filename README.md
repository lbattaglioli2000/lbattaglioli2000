### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸš€ Currently, I'm working as a web developer at <a href="https://deevoted.com/" target="_blank">Deevoted</a>!
- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm hackin' away on a project called <a href="https://thestoq.app/" target="_blank">Stoq</a>!
- ðŸ‘¯ I love collaborating on stuff, so if you want to bounce ideas or work on something, reach out to me!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mentoring! I'd love to share what I know, learn something new from you, or just see what you're working on! Especially if you're new to programming!

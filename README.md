### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸš€ Currently, I'm working as a web developer at Deevoted! I'm a very deevoted developer, you might say.
- ðŸ”­ I'm also hackin' away on a side project, called Abacus! It's a household inventory manager, and shopping list... with a lovely little REST API, and realtime event broadcasting system. :smirk: It is kind of an ambitious project for me to tackle alone, so if you're interested in a lil' pair programming, you want to learn more, or want to help a fella out, I'd love to connect. Shoot me an email, it's down below.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m teaching myself several different things. I'm focusing on mobile development right now, learning SwiftUI, and also Ionic Vue for cross platform applications. All super interesting stuff right there.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d absolutely love to collaborate on any web projects your working on.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mentoring! I'd love to share my knowledge, or just see what you're working on! Especially if you're new to programming! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: him@theluigi.com
